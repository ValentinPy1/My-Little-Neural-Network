# Hands-On Workshop: Building a Neural Network for MNIST with Keras and TensorFlow

## Overview

This workshop is a practical, code-along session where you will build a neural network to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. Each exercise is designed to introduce you to different aspects of neural network development using Keras and TensorFlow, culminating in a fully functional model by the end of the workshop.

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge.
- TensorFlow and Keras installed on your machine.

## Installation

Ensure Python, TensorFlow, and Keras are installed:
- Python: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- TensorFlow: Run `pip install tensorflow`
- Keras: Run `pip install keras`

## Workshop Exercises

### Exercise 1: Setup and Data Loading (Duration: 20 minutes)
- Import TensorFlow and Keras.
- Load the MNIST dataset using Keras (`keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()`).
- Explore the dataset: print shapes and visualize some digits.

### Exercise 2: Preprocessing the Data (Duration: 30 minutes)
- Normalize the data for model training.
- Flatten the images for input into a neural network.
- Convert labels to categorical (one-hot encoding).

### Exercise 3: Building the Neural Network (Duration: 40 minutes)
- Create a Sequential model in Keras.
- Add a Dense layer with appropriate input shape and activation function.
- Add more layers, experimenting with different numbers of neurons.

### Exercise 4: Compiling the Model (Duration: 20 minutes)
- Compile the model with an optimizer, loss function, and metrics.
- Discuss the role of each component in model training.

### Exercise 5: Training the Model (Duration: 40 minutes)
- Train the model using the MNIST training data.
- Discuss parameters like batch size and number of epochs.
- Observe the training process and discuss overfitting.

### Exercise 6: Evaluating and Improving the Model (Duration: 30 minutes)
- Evaluate the model on test data.
- Discuss common techniques to improve model performance.

### Exercise 7: Saving and Loading the Model (Duration: 20 minutes)
- Save the trained model.
- Load the model and make predictions on test data.

## Workshop Conclusion

- Recap of the steps taken to build and train the neural network.
- Open floor for questions and troubleshooting.
